## Script Custom Function

With the **Script Engine** there is the possibility use **custom functions**. This gives the user a chance to really cutomize how scripts works and to use the extensive **Cookie Touch Bot API**.

[Cookie Touch Bot API](https://github.com/Ehstrali/markdownedit "Cookie Touch Bot API")

For this we will take a look at a custom function to talk to the npc to go from **Incarnam** to **Astrub**.

{% method %}

Before using an instruction from the API you need to remember to use the keyword **yield** as follows.

{% sample lang="js" %}
```js
//Title: Incarnam To Astrub
//Version: 1.0.0
//Type: 1
//Tags: path, incarnam, astrub
//Description: This is a script that is made to bring you from Incarnam to Astrub.
```
{% endmethod %}
