## Script Header

This script header is probably the most important part of the script. This will let the dev team add your script to the **public script repositery** where other users will be able to download and use scripts as well as vote if it works well or not.

```js
//Title: Incarnam To Astrub
//Version: 1.0.0
//Type: 1
//Tags: path, incarnam, astrub
//Description: This is a script that is made to bring you from Incarnam to Astrub.
```
